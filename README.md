# Portfolio

Hello there.

This repository is my portfolio and has one unique concept.

"Let's quietly write about what I know with a outsider's perspective. Even if it is not novelty to me, it may be valuable information for someone."

If you are interested, look at the [wiki](https://github.com/uupaa/Portfolio/wiki).
